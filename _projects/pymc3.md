PyMC3 is a Python package for Bayesian statistical modeling and Probabilistic Machine Learning which focuses on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational fitting algorithms. PyMC3 features intuitive model specification syntax, powerful sampling algorithms, variational inference, and transparent support for missing value imputation. It relies on Theano, which provides computation optimization and dynamic C compilation, NumPy broadcasting and advanced indexing, linear algebra operators, and simple extensibility.
