Cantera is an open source suite of object-oriented software tools for problems
involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and/or transport processes. The
software automates the chemical kinetic, thermodynamic, and transport
calculations so that the users can efficiently incorporate detailed chemical
thermo-kinetics and transport models into their calculations.

The code utilizes object-oriented concepts for robust yet flexible phase models,
and algorithms are generalized so that users can explore different phase models
with minimal changes to their overall code. Currently, Cantera can be used from
Python and Matlab, or in applications written in C++ and Fortran 90. Cantera
also provides a limited number of solvers for time-dependent reactor networks
and steady one-dimensional reacting flows.
