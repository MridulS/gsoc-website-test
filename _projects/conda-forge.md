Conda-forge builds and distributes software packages, specializing in the
hard-to-build or unique packages that often arise in a scientific computing
context. Conda-forge is community-driven and community-curated. This means that
no package is too domain-specific and all packages undergo review to ensure
quality and interoperability. Conda-forge has a federated structure, where each
package has its own list of maintainers, which anyone can join. This helps
ensure that people who care about a package are the ones responsible for
maintaining it. The conda-forge ecosystem is fully structured around automation.
This lets our maintainers build packages for systems they do not own (like
Windows or Mac), keep their packages up-to-date automatically, and ensure their
packages maintain the highest level of quality.
