question: "Am I Experienced Enough?"
---
The answer is generally: **Yes**. We value creativity, intelligence and
enthusiasm above specific knowledge of the libraries or algorithms we use. We
think that an interested and motivated student who is willing to learn is more
valuable than anything else. The range of available projects should suit people
with different backgrounds. At the same time if you have experience using your
project of choice or one of it's dependencies (e.g. language) make sure to let
us know about that as
well.

gives a good overview of this part for GSoC.
