question: "What are my obligations as a mentor during the GSoC?"
---

We expect you to:

Participate in weekly meetings with your student.
* Review your students pull requests timely.
* Get in contact with the admins if any even remotely
potential problems arise.

If you are interested in mentoring, please contact one of the admins
indicating the reason your open source project is suitable to be included as
a project to be mentored under the NumFOCUS administrative umbrella.

<!-- List of admins is [here](http://projects.coala.io/#/mentors). -->
