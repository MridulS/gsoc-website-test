## Organizations Eligible Under NumFOCUS Umbrella

Organizations either financially supported or affiliated with NumFOCUS can
participate under the NumFOCUS umbrella. The organization must also have:

1. One sub-org admin
   and at least two mentors (**the sub-org admin can be one of the mentors**)
   who are willing to commit for the full GSoC period.
2. Must be a NumFOCUS sponsored or affiliated project
3. Have a good ideas page (**NumFOCUS Admins will help with that**).

The sub org administrator and has the responsibility to communicate with
NumFOCUS and advertise GSoC to the community of their organization.

You can signup as a participating org with us until the application deadline for
the current year or up to 3 days after Google announces that NumFOCUS is
participating as a umbrella org.

When you sign-up with us you should also tell us your preferred way for students
to contact you and a link to your new contributor page if you have one.

## Sub Org Administrators

Each project/organization under NumFOCUS umbrella for GSoC should have one
administrator.

The **sub-org admins** are responsible for

- provide a list of projects ideas to **organization administrator**
- advertise the application to the project/organization they represent
- signup mentors with NumFOCUS
- connect users with NumFOCUS profile
- request to **organization administrator** a minimum and a maximum number of
  slots
- assign mentors and students to available slots
- ensure evaluations for accepted projects are submitted on time
- Try to have the whole community engage with the students in their project

## Project Mentors

NumFOCUS has two mentors for every project:

1.  **Primary mentor**: responsible for the administrative tasks of the project.
2.  **Secondary mentor**: has little to no responsibility, but provides backup
    and code review for aspects of the project which are relevant to their
    expertise.
