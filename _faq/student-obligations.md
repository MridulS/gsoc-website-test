# During the summer

*The items here are a requirement for students during the summer*

**Communication**

- Write a short report for us every evaluation period in a blog
- Commit early and commit often! Push to a public repository (e.g. github) so
  that we can see and review your work.
- Actively work on our project timeline and communicate with us during the
  community bonding period.
- Communicate every working day with your mentor. Preferably in public using the
  standard channels of your project.
- If there is a reason why you can't work or can't contact us on a regular basis
  please make us aware of this.
- If you don't communicate with us regularly we will fail you.

**Evaluations**

- Set a realistic goal for all evaluation deadlines. If you fail to meet your
  own goal we are more likely to fail you in the evaluations.
- Create at least one public commit that has been reviewed before each
  evaluation.
- Have at least one commit merged into the current development branch of your
  project at the end of the summer to pass the final evaluation.
- The last point is a hard requirement. Make sure that your time plan includes
  time for the review process.
  
**Blog**

- keep a regular journal of your experience as a student and blog at least once
  every evaluation period.
